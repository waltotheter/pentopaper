A turn based RGP based on https://www.d20pfsrd.com/ meant for games with friends when its difficult to get together on gaming night. I imagine rolling games, and people with multiple characters so they can drop in to appropriate level games. This app will have the ability for the DM to create campaigns, including designing maps, encounters and even running an A.I. for your encounters. You will also be able to print out all you session details to have your game in person instead on online when we can all meet up! In the end there will also be a chat system and hopefully video conferencing. I think we should also be able to record sessions in video, exportable data, and pdf/jpeg screen shots.  More feature ideas will be added.
